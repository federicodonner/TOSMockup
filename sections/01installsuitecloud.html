  <h2>Install SuiteCloud SDK</h2>
  <p>
    SuiteApp development is done locally. This enables many modern coding good
    practices, such as the use of version control tools, which we emphatically
    recommend.
  </p>
  <p>
    We offer an SDK that gives you many actions to make the development process
    much easier and smoother. You can install the SDK by navigating to:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <a href="https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk" target="_blank"
      >https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk</a
    >
  </div>
  <p>Alternatively, you can install the SuiteCloud extension for VSCode.</p>
