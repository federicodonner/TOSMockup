  <h2>SuiteCloud SDK</h2>
  <p>
    SuiteApp development is done locally. This enables many modern coding good
    practices, such as the use of version control tools, which we emphatically
    recommend.
  </p>
  <p>
    We offer an SDK that provides any actions to make the development process
    easier and smoother. You can install the SDK by navigating to:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <a href="https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk" target="_blank"
      >https://github.com/oracle/netsuite-suitecloud-sdk</a
    >
  </div>
  <p>
    You can access the SDK functionality either using the Node CLI or the
    SuiteCloud extension for VSCode. The latter has almost all the
    functionalities the SDK has to offer. Throughout this Quick Start we're
    going to use the Node CLI.

    <p>Pay special attention to the prerequisites before installing the CLI.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    After the install is complete, navigate to an empty folder from your
    terminal and run the following command:
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud</div>
  <p>We will explore the different commands throughout this tutorial.</p>
