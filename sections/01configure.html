  <h2>Quick Start</h2>
  <p>Welcome to SuiteCloud development!</p>
  <p>
    This page will give you an introduction to the core concepts of developing
    for NetSuite. We will configure the local environment and create our first
    SuiteApp.
  </p>
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    Before we start make sure you have access to a Test Drive account. They're
    provisioned to partners during the SDN onboarding process. In the next
    section we'll discuss the different types of accounts and how to best use
    them. You can recognize your Test Drive accounts by the account number in
    the URL. It should start with "tstdrv" or "td".
  </p>
  <div class="asid">
    <p>
      You as a partner have access to NetSuite's account on NetSuite for basic
      actions such as registering SuiteApps and contact details. You do not have
      permissions, though, to push your SuiteApp to that account. You can
      recognize it by the URL as well, it's the only account that starts with
      nlcorp.

    <p>
      We will go over more of what you can do in the nlcorp account in further
      sections.

    In order to be able to use your test drive account for SuiteCloud
    development, we need to make sure some configurations are set correctly. On
    the center, go to
  </p>
  <div class="code">Setup -> Company -> Enable features</div>
  <p>
    There select the last subtab: SuiteCloud, and make sure that the following
    configurations are turned on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Token-Based Authentication</li>
    <li>Oauth 2.0</li>
    <li>SuiteCloud Development Framework</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These configurations allow local SuiteCloud tools to interact with the
    account such as pushing code and importing objects.
