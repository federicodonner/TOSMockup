  <h2>What is NetSuite customization?</h2>
  <h3>Welcome to SuiteCloud development!</h3>
  <p>
    This page will give you an introduction to the core concepts of developing
    for NetSuite. We will configure the local environment and create our first
    SuiteApp.
  </p>
  <p>
    But first, we have to go through what NetSuite is and what possibilities ot
    offeres for customization.
  </p>
  <h3>What is NetSuite</h3>
  <p>
    NetSuite is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform. What set it
    apart from others is the possibilities for customization. Every process
    offers hooks for custom functions, data can be accessed securely from
    external systems and many different types of scripts allow the creation of
    tailored experience for the users.
  </p>
  <p>
    SuiteCloud Developers Network (SDN) empowers NetSuite partners to create
    SuiteApps that package this custom functionality and offer it to our mutual
    customers via a marketplace.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      SuiteApps are one or many scripts packaged and deployed to customers'
      accounts. Each script (called SuiteScripts) can be of one of multiple
      types depending on its functionality. Some scripts simply run code on
      demand, others get linked to specific core ERP operations, others show an
      interface or can be called from external systems. Your solution will be
      comprised of as many SuiteScrips as necessary.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    Before we start make sure you have access to a Test Drive account. They're
    provisioned to partners during the SDN onboarding process. In the next
    sections we'll discuss the different types of accounts and how to best use
    them. You can recognize your Test Drive accounts by the account number in
    the URL. It should start with "tstdrv" or "td".
  </p>
  <p>These accounts are full production accounts. This means two things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      No one from NetSuite can grant access to the account if everyone in your
      team gets locked out. Please make sure to create a few Administrators.
    </li>
    <li>
      Everything your customers can do in their accounts can be done in the
      development accounts, so your SuiteApp can be fully tested and validated
      before deploying it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      You as a partner have access to NetSuite's account on NetSuite for basic
      actions such as registering SuiteApps and contact details. You do not have
      permissions, though, to push your SuiteApp to that account. You can
      recognize it by the URL as well, it's the only account that starts with
      nlcorp.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will go over more of what you can do in the nlcorp account in further
      sections.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    In order to be able to use your test drive account for SuiteCloud
    development, we need to make sure some configurations are set correctly. On
    the center, go to
  </p>
  <div class="code">Setup -> Company -> Enable features</div>
  <p>
    There select the last subtab: SuiteCloud, and make sure that the following
    configurations are turned on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Token-Based Authentication</li>
    <li>Oauth 2.0</li>
    <li>SuiteCloud Development Framework</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These configurations allow local SuiteCloud tools to interact with the
    account, such as pushing code and importing objects.
