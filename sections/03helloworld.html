  <h2>Hello World!</h2>
  <p>What we've done so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Configured your Test Drive account for development</li>
    <li>Installed the SuiteCloud SDK</li>
    <li>Created your first project</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now we're going to give the project some functionality.</p>
  <p>
    In this first example we're going to create what we call a
    <b>native SuiteApp</b>. These have objects that run completely within
    NetSuite. All the business logic, the UI and the interactions occur inside
    of your customer's NetSuite account.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      There are different types of SuiteScripts we can use, we're going to
      create a SuiteLet. These SuiteScripts are similar to a webpage, once
      deployed they expose a URL and methods that run when it gets loaded. There
      are also UI elements that can be rendered for the user to interact with.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    For this example we're going to create our script in the
    FileCabinet/SuiteApps/[applicationID] folder. If you don't see that route in
    your SuiteApp project, please refer to previous sections of this tutorial.
  </p>
  <p>Let's name the file:</p>
  <div class="code">firstSuiteLet.js</div>
