  <h2>Hello World!</h2>
  <p>What we've done so far:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Configured your Test Drive account for development</li>
    <li>Installed the SuiteCloud SDK</li>
    <li>Created your first project</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now we're going to give the project some functionality.</p>
  <p>
    In this first example we're going to create what we call a
    <b>native SuiteApp</b>. These have objects that run completely within
    NetSuite. All the business logic, the UI and the interactions occur inside
    of your customer's NetSuite account.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      There are different types of SuiteScripts we can use, we're going to
      create a SuiteLet. These SuiteScripts are similar to a webpage, once
      deployed they expose a URL and methods that run when it gets loaded. There
      are also UI elements that can be rendered for the user to interact with.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    For this example we're going to create our script in the
    FileCabinet/SuiteApps/[applicationID] folder. If you don't see that route in
    your SuiteApp project, please refer to previous sections of this tutorial.
  </p>
  <p>Let's name the file:</p>
  <div class="code">firstSuiteLet.js</div>
  <p>
    To allow NetSuite to understand and interact with the SuiteScript correctly,
    we need to indicate which type of SuiteScript it is and which version it's
    using. These indications are done using <b>javadoc</b> style comments, so
    lets's start our script file with:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    /** <br />* @NApiVersion 2.1 <br />* @NScriptType Suitelet <br />*/
  </div>
  <p>
    These comments indicate that we're going to be using the API Version 2.1 and
    that the SuiteScript is a SuiteLet.
  </p>
  <p>
    SuiteScripts' are coded using javascript and API version 2.1 fully
    implements ECMAScript 6. Additionally, SuiteScripts use the define syntax,
    which receives an array of dependencies and a callback function that will be
    loaded. That function receives the dependencies as parameters to make them
    available within the code.
  </p>
  <div class="code">define(["N/record"], function (record) {})</div>
  <p>
    In this example you have imported the "N/record" module. Modules in
    SuiteScrips give additional functionality to the code, exposing methods and
    allowin the script to access NetSuite's internal elements. There are dozens
    with different functionalities, for now we're only going to use the
    "N/record" module.
  </p>
  <p>
    To complete the syntax you need the function to return a function that will
    be run when the SuiteLet is loaded. Inside the fuction, add:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    return {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onRequest,<br />
    };
  </div>
  <p>
    You still don't have an onRequest function to return, so probably your code
    editor is giving you errors, we'll get there.
  </p>
  <p>Up to this point firstSuiteLet.js should look like this:</p>
  <div class="code">
    /**<br />
    * @NApiVersion 2.x<br />
    * @NScriptType Suitelet<br />
    */<br />
    define(["N/record"], function (record) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onRequest,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br />
    });
  </div>
  <p>
    You created the structure for the SuiteApp and imported a module, but now it
    needs functionality. Let's add the onRequest function before the return
    statement:
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    function onRequest(context) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (context.request.method === "GET") {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const salesOrder = record.load({<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type:
    record.Type.SALES_ORDER,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; id: "1",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const entity = salesOrder.getValue({
    fieldId: "entity"});<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; log.debug("entity", entity);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
    }
  </div>
  <p>
    There is a lot to unpack in that code, let's analyze the main components.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      "context" is an object that's implicity acccessible to all SuiteScripts.
      It exposes attributes such as the request and the NetSuite session, for
      example. In this case you're using context to access the request method to
      make sure that the SuiteLet is loaded by the browser before executing the
      logic.
    </li>
    <li>
      The "N/record" module ("record" inside the function) is used to load the
      sales order with id of 1. Your Test Drive accounts is pre-populated with
      test data, make sure that the specified ID exists on your Sales Orders
      list. Feel free to change the id to another one if you prefer.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code uses the function log.debug that comes from the "N/log" module.
      That module is implicitly imported into every SuiteScipt so it's always
      available.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      You may have noticed that, although SuiteScripts are similiar to webpages,
      this specific one does not render anything quite yet, it only loads a
      record and logs one of its attributes. Let's add the promised Hello World!
      to the code.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    SuiteLets need to show something to the user. Usually that information has
    to do with the objects being fetched or the logic behind the scenes, for
    this example you're only going to render the famous "Hello World!" sentence.
  </p>
  <p>For that, add the following code inside the onRequest function:</p>
  <div class="code">
    var html = "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello
    World!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";<br />
    context.response.write(html);
  </div>
  <p>
    This code is pretty straighforward to understand, it creates an html object
    and writes it using the context.response method
  </p>
  <p>After all these steps, your SuiteLet code should look like this:</p>
  <div class="code">
    /**<br />
    * @NApiVersion 2.x<br />
    * @NScriptType Suitelet<br />
    */<br />

    define(["N/record"], function (record) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function onRequest(context) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (context.request.method === "GET")
    {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const salesOrder =
    record.load({<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    type: record.Type.SALES_ORDER,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    id: "1",<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; });<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const entity =
    salesOrder.getValue({ fieldId: "entity" });<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; log.debug("entity",
    entity);<br />
    <br />

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var html =
    "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello
    World!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    context.response.write(html);<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onRequest: onRequest,<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };<br />
    });<br />
  </div>
</main>
