  <h2>Deploying your SuiteLet</h2>
  <p>
    Everything you've done until now is local, and your SuiteLet needs the
    NetSuite context to run so we have to deploy it to a NetSuite account,
    you're going to use your Test Drive account we configured earlier. For that
    we need to link it to the SuiteCloud SDK.
  </p>
  <p>On your command line, run the command</p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud account:setup</div>
  <p>
    You will have to enter an authentication ID, that's used to recognize the
    authentication later, you could have many accounts for development purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process will continue on the browser by authenticating with NetSuite.
    You will need to choose a role that has the Oauth 2.0 permissions, if you're
    an administrator in the account it should work.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      If you're not an administrator in the account, you can request one to give
      you the appropriate permissions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <img src="../images/authentication.png" alt="Authentication" />
  <p>
    Once you're authenticated, you can push your SuiteApp to the Test Drive
    account by running the command
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud project:deploy</div>
  <p>
    That command will validate the code and deploy it into the account. Because
    our SuiteApp is very simple, the validation will not return any issues, you
    might need to add dependencies to your SuiteApp by running the code
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud project:adddependencies</div>
  <p>
    That will edit the manifest.xml file to add the required dependencies for
    your code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the SuiteApp is deployed into your Test Drive account you can verify
    it's there by going to
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    Customization -> SuiteCloud development -> Installed SuiteApp list
  </div>
  <img src="../images/installedSuiteApp.png" alt="Installed SuiteApp" />
  <p>
    Having the SuiteApp installed means that the objects were cretead in the
    account but the script is not deployed yet. In order to create a deployment
    for your script, go to
  </p>
  <div class="code">Customization -> Scripting -> Scripts -> New</div>
  <p>
    There, choose "firstSuiteLet.js" as the script and click on Create Script
    Record, then fill out the form
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      When creating NetSuite objects, you'll be asked for an ID. NetSuite adds
      the object type in front of the ID (for example, scripts' IDs would start
      with "custscript"). It's a good practice to start your IDs with a low dash
      ( _ ) so that the ID you enter gets separated from the type added
      automatically by NetSuite.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Make sure to navigate to the Deployments subtad and add deployment
    information for the script.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the script is deployed, you'll need to add the deployment information
    to your SuiteApp. This process we just went through of creating the script
    record and deploying it can de done as onboarding steps for whoever is
    installing your SuiteApp, but it can be also done automatically by importing
    the SuiteApp deployment record to the project. That way, when the SuiteApp
    is deployed, the script gets deployed automatically as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do that, go back to the terminal on your project and type in the command
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud object:import -i</div>
  <p>
    Because you added the -i flag to the command, SuiteCloud will ask you for
    information regarding which object to import. Choose not to filter for type
    or SuiteApp and on the object types list, choose Script - Suitelet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once done, you'll see that there is a new file in the Objects folder of your
    project. It's the script record with the deployment information.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      Objects in NetSuite are represented by xml files. If you knew the
      structure of the files you could create objects and deploy them directly
      into NetSuite. It's usually easier to let NetSuite create the object by
      specifying it in the UI and then importing it to the project.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    After you have the script record on your project, you could try to deploy
    your SuiteApp again by running
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud project:deploy</div>
  <p>
    Deployment fails now. What happened was that the SuiteApp now has an object
    that's already present in the account, and because that object didn't come
    from the SuiteApp (you created it a minute ago in the UI), it represents a
    conflict and the deployment can't continue. To solve this you'll need to
    perform an unexpected step:
  </p>
  <p>Delete the script record from the account.</p>
  <p>
    Don't worry, you won't lose any configurations because the object is already
    imported into your project. Go ahead, go back to the script record you have
    open on your NetSuite instance, click on Edit and then Actions -> Delete.
    Now, try deploying your SuiteApp again.
  </p>

  <p>Success!</p>
  <p>Now go to your NetSuite instance and navigate to</p>
  <div class="code">Customization -> Scripting -> Scripts</div>
  <p>And try to find your script firstSuitelet</p>
  <p>
    Open the record and navigate to the Deployments subtab and click on the
    deployment you configured earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
    There, you'll see the SuiteLet URL, clicking it will open it and you'll be
    able to see it in all its glory.
  </p>
  <img src="../images/helloworld.png" alt="Hello World" />
  <p>
    One last thing, go back to the script record and navigate to the Execution
    Logs subtab, there you'll see the log we added to the script that specifies
    the entity of the Sales Order we loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations! You just created and deployed your first SuiteApp. The
    deployment process to your customers will do the exact same to their
    accounts, except that they'll access your SuiteApp via the marketplace and
    it won't be directly deployed.
  </p>
