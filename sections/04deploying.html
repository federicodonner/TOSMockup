  <h2>Deploying your SuiteLet</h2>
  <p>
    Everything you've done until now is local, and your SuiteLet needs the
    NetSuite context to run so we have to deploy it to a NetSuite account,
    you're going to use your Test Drive account we configured earlier. For that
    we need to link it to the SuiteCloud SDK.
  </p>
  <p>On your command line, run the command</p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud account:setup</div>
  <p>
    You will have to enter an authentication ID, that's used to recognize the
    authentication later, you could have many accounts for development purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process will continue on the browser by authenticating with NetSuite.
    You will need to choose a role that has the Oauth 2.0 permissions, if you're
    an administrator in the account it should work.
  </p>
  <div class="aside">
    <p>
      If you're not an administrator in the account, you can request one to give
      you the appropriate permissions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <img src="../images/authentication.png" alt="Authentication" />
  <p>
    Once you're authenticated, you can push your SuiteApp to the Test Drive
    account by running the command
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud project:deploy</div>
  <p>
    That command will validate the code and deploy it into the account. Because
    our SuiteApp is very simple, the validation will not return any issues, you
    might need to add dependencies to your SuiteApp by running the code
  </p>
  <div class="code">suitecloud project:adddependencies</div>
  <p>
    That will edit the manifest.xml file to add the required dependencies for
    your code.
  </p>
